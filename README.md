# ðŸ§  Natural Language Linux Assistant & Smart Command Executor

This project combines two smart command-line tools:

1. **Natural Language Linux Assistant** â€“ Converts human instructions (like "make a folder called test") into Linux shell commands using the **Gemini Pro API**.
2. **Command Validator & Suggestor** â€“ Validates, executes Linux commands, and suggests alternatives if a user mistypes them (e.g., `gti` â†’ `git`).
